I'll help you fix your PDF form's radio buttons. To group radio buttons properly in a PDF, you need to ensure each question's radio buttons share the same field name but have different export values.

For editing PDF forms, here are some free options:

LibreOffice Draw
Completely free and open-source
Can edit PDF forms including radio button properties
A bit clunky but gets the job done
PDF-XChange Editor (Free Version)
More user-friendly interface
Has a free version with form editing capabilities
Some features are watermarked in free version but radio button editing is available
Here's how to fix your radio button groups:

Using PDF-XChange Editor (easiest option):

Open your PDF
Enter Forms Editing mode (usually under "Forms" menu)
Select all radio buttons for Question 1
In properties panel, give them all the same "Field Name" (e.g., "Question1")
Give each button in the group a different "Export Value" (e.g., "A", "B", "C", "D")
Repeat for each question's set of radio buttons using different field names
Using LibreOffice Draw:

Import your PDF
Select each radio button
Right-click and select "Form Control Properties"
Set the same "Name" for all buttons in one question
Set different "Option" values for each button
Repeat for each question
Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail? Also, which software would you prefer to use? I can provide more specific instructions based on your choice.

You
​
By Stevie Wonder voice over ...

To the tune of
   "I just called to say..."

Nick to Chris @ 2:30 AM random call ...

 Replace "I love you" with...

You owe money
I'm pregnant / we are pregnant
I miss you
Cold out baby
Your car's unlocked
Nice jock strap
The beers warm
Stubbed my toe
Stove is on
I have herpes
About those meds
Yeah, that acid
Out of milk
I'm sickly
It's cold out
I don't care
I'm sleepy
Tuna melt
You scare me
Those apples
Morroco
Tomorrow
Go eagles
Wrong bed
Late for work
Wear sunscreen
I found you
Borrow your shoe?
Use my razor
Out of TP
STD
Popsicles
Life is good
Travel well
Walnut Creek
Aunt Charlie's
I did it
Grease her up
Just dip it
Just the tip
Tip next time
Word for you?
Slow baby
It's dark out
Dry January
Rack em up
Gotta go pee
It Still hurts
Peeing hurts
Dishes still dirty
Tab is due
Want another?
The bright side
I overdosed
Goodbye horses
Tenderness
Praise God
Unbelievable
Need a friend
I'll be there
The right words
Wait for me
I'm sorry
I'll promise you
Miso soup
Green curry
Boilermaker
I want Bush
Hi cookies
Cupcake queen
Hate the chiefs
Microwave
Toaster oven
More cookies
Help me move
I'm over you
Wishful thinking
Let it be
Keep going east
Ship sinking
King of you
Rent is late
Need the check
Cetera
Gloria of Love
Let it go
Rub it out
My mermaid
I want to see
Breaking hearts
Tiny bubbles
Last dance silly
I need you
Dance with me
I need you
Please hold me
My baby dock
Wasting time
Rest'n bones
Tide roll'n in
You're my Donna
Time to drink
No Time for old men
Need more bush
Scratch my butt
Stop it don't
What the fuck
Turn lights off
Cops are here
