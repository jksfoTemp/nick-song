You
​
By Stevie Wonder voice over ...

To the tune of
   "I just called to say..."

Nick to Chris @ 2:30 AM random call ...

 Replace "I love you" with...

You owe money
I'm pregnant / we are pregnant
I miss you
Cold out baby
Your car's unlocked
Nice jock strap
The beers warm
Stubbed my toe
Stove is on
I have herpes
About those meds
Yeah, that acid
Out of milk
I'm sickly
It's cold out
I don't care
I'm sleepy
Tuna melt
You scare me
Those apples
Morroco
Tomorrow
Go eagles
Wrong bed
Late for work
Wear sunscreen
I found you
Borrow your shoe?
Use my razor
Out of TP
STD
Popsicles
Life is good
Travel well
Walnut Creek
Aunt Charlie's
I did it
Grease her up
Just dip it
Just the tip
Tip next time
Word for you?
Slow baby
It's dark out
Dry January
Rack em up
Gotta go pee
It Still hurts
Peeing hurts
Dishes still dirty
Tab is due
Want another?
The bright side
I overdosed
Goodbye horses
Tenderness
Praise God
Unbelievable
Need a friend
I'll be there
The right words
Wait for me
I'm sorry
I'll promise you
Miso soup
Green curry
Boilermaker
I want Bush
Hi cookies
Cupcake queen
Hate the chiefs
Microwave
Toaster oven
More cookies
Help me move
I'm over you
Wishful thinking
Let it be
Keep going east
Ship sinking
King of you
Rent is late
Need the check
Cetera
Gloria of Love
Let it go
Rub it out
My mermaid
I want to see
Breaking hearts
Tiny bubbles
Last dance silly
I need you
Dance with me
I need you
Please hold me
My baby dock
Wasting time
Rest'n bones
Tide roll'n in
You're my Donna
Time to drink
No Time for old men
Need more bush
Scratch my butt
Stop it don't
What the fuck
Turn lights off
Cops are here
